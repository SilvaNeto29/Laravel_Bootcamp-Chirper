# Message Board | Quadro de mensagens | Laravel

  Hello! This is a project in Laravel where a group of users can talk to each other through 'message blocks', like a tweet or a conversation in a WhatsApp or Telegram group.

  The entire front-end of the project was downloaded from https://bootcamp.laravel.com/ and the language used to remove the staticity of the app was Blade, from Laravel itself.

## Stack

**Front-end:** Blade, HTML, TailwindCSS

**Back-end:** PHP 8.2, Laravel 10, MySQL 8


## Installation

Install the project locally!

We need to have Mysql, Composer, PHP and Vite (For TailWind) running. For that we need to start Mysql somehow (for my development environment I used XAMPP). Composer is installed previously, PHP and Vite will do with commands in the terminal:

```bash
  git clone
  cd project
  php artisan serve 
  composer require laravel/breeze --dev 
  php artisan breeze:install blade
  npm run dev 
  php artisan migrate
```
